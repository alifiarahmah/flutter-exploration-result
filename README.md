# flutter-exploration-result
Result of my exploration about Flutter, one of Google Developer Products.

Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
Flutter allows us to build a cross-platform application (Android, iOS, Web) with a single codebase.

When we build something with Flutter, we use a programming language called Dart.<br>
Dart was also developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.

Flutter has been used in a lot of applications, including Tencent, Realtor.com, The New York Times, and others.

[Here](https://github.com/alifiarahmah/flutter-test-app) is my mini project I've made using Flutter.
